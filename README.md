# Petition Email #

The Petition Email CiviCRM extension allows you to automatically trigger an email everytime someone signs a petition. The email can go to one or more static targets or you can do a dyna mic lookup of targets by matching the value of a field in the petition signer's contact with a value in a target group's contact.

If combined with an extension that can do auto-lookups of electoral districts (such as the [CiviCRM Cicero](https://drupal.org/project/civicrm_cicero) module) , you can use this extension for e-advocacy campaigns.
